This is a simple Blog application where you can post images and users can like or post comments. This is a basic MERN application that supports all CRUD functions related to a blog. This application has very limited features compared to real world blog apps because i made this for beginners to learn how backend works and hence reduced the complextity.
The frontend is made using HTML,EJS,bootstrap CSS, backend is made using NodeJS and MongoDB. Here we can post only photos, and they are stored locally using multer. This project basically has on strong backend that focuses on only CRUD operations, hence several features such as account management, video posting, multiple posts together etc. are not implemented.
